This project contains a student project (be tolerant) I did for the Android master at UPMC. It is a fight game in Unity, between zombies and students, fighting to take the control of the university (and then cancel the exams? Such a subliminal message!). The objective of the project was to implement AI on Unity, which was done here for controlling the NPC automatically (depending on a few feelings: view, smell, etc). I should check it again deeper to provide a more informative description, but don't know if I will find time for this anytime soon (but feel free to ask if you are interested).
